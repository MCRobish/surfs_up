# Module 9 Challenge: Surfs_Up
## Overview of the Analysis: 
The purpose of this challenge is to understand the temperature trends in Oahu in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. Specifically, the months of June and December were reviewed for variation through the years of 2010 to 2017.
## Results:
* It appears based on the data that the temperature variation in December is lower than the variation in June. This is shown in the histograms below
* The mean temperature for December has historically been 71 degrees F and the mean temperature for June was 75 degrees F. 
* According to the summary statistics, only 25% of the days in December for the last 7 years have been colder than 669 degrees F. This is colder than the lower quartile for June at 73 degrees F; however, both could still be considered ice cream weather.
