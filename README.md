# Module 9 Challenge: Surfs_Up
## Overview of the Analysis: 
The purpose of this challenge is to understand the temperature trends in Oahu in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. Specifically, the months of June and December were reviewed for variation through the years of 2010 to 2017.
## Results:
* It appears based on the data that the temperature variation in December is lower than the variation in June. This is shown in the histograms below
* The mean temperature for December has historically been 71 degrees F and the mean temperature for June was 75 degrees F. 
* According to the summary statistics, only 25% of the days in December for the last 7 years have been colder than 669 degrees F. This is colder than the lower quartile for June at 73 degrees F; however, both could still be considered ice cream weather.

## Summary:
In general, it does not appear that temperature should be a significant impact to business because the temperature ranges in December have historically been mild. If there were concerns about lower water temperatures on the cooler days, the surfing business could provide discounts on wetsuit rentals for those days to keep business moving. 


**Rainfall Query**


It would also be important to consider rainfall averages, as those will also affect business. It appears that for bot months, the majority of the days have between 0 to 1 inch of rain. For June, it appears that of the 1700 days of data collected, there were only 126 days where there was no rainfall at all. For December, it appears that of the 1517 entries, there were 112 days with no rain.

</p>

Though this initially sounds like a lot of closed days for rain, December shows that 75% of the reported days have less than 0.15 inches of rain and June has 75% with less than 0.12 inches. It appears that most of these showers are very short in duration and should not cause extended closures of the shop.
